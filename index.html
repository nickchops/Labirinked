<p>Labirinked is a fast-paced 2D tile-based puzzle game where two plays had to play together to win. It seems to also be becoming a thing that I need to make games based around terrible puns: so yes, this is a game based on a terrible pun!</p>

<p>It was started as part of Global Game Jam 2015. The idea was to make a coop touch game with a simple strong pen on ink look. I convinced work to let me go to the Rome GGJ event with a colleague ("working from Rome", did I mention terrible puns?) and teamed up with a very nice artist called Rocco who I met a few minutes earlier. It sat around in a very alpha form since them and I decided to polish it up for <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">http://www.onegameamonth.com/</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-play" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to play</h2>

<p>The idea is to drop tile pieces onto the game play area to create paths for the two characters to follow and find eachother before the timer runs out. The game was designed for two player cooperative play but you can also play on your own- just use two fingers and go as fast as possible! Tile pieces are shared and you can grab them from the other players square if you want!</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-next" class="anchor" href="#what-next" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What next?</h2>

<p>Labirinked is definitely experimental. The drag and drop mechanic and the art deco-y ink-on-paper look and feel are pretty cool, but we didn't get as far as designing levels, so its currently just random. Not sure if I'll work on it some more but I might re-use the tile mechanic for something else. It might be cool with a level editor and the ability to create pre-populated mazes that you have to "fix" to get out of....</p>

<h2>
<a id="code" class="anchor" href="#code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code?</h2>

<p>The code's all on GitHub. Get it from here and steel whatever you want, but please provide some credit or at least let me know the code was useful to you :)</p>
