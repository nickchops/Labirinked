Game built for Global Game Jam 2015

Uses Marmalade Quick.

Theme was "What Do We Do Now?" It's a very literal interpretation!

2 player real time cooperative puzzle game where you have to build paths to find eachother.

Current code has had quite a bit of bug fixing since the jam!
Needs a little UX improvement. Needs more tiles and level design! But a fun
prototype. Might rework it into something else...
