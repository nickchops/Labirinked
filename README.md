Game built for Global Game Jam 2015

Uses Marmalade Quick.

Theme was "What Do We Do Now?" It's a very literal interpretation!

2 player real time cooperative puzzle game where you have to build paths to find eachother.

First upload is last "working" version. Will update once some bugs are worked out of the final Jam version. Currently it's pretty unplayable! More of a prototype than game :paths
